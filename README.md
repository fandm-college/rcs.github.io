# Research Computing Services

Research Computing Services (RCS) supports the computational needs related to both research and teaching 
when those needs move beyond the capabailities of a standard personal computer.
Our goal is to make the access and use of specialized compute resources easier for faculty and students 
at Franklin & Marshall College as well as to facilitate collaboration across institutions.
