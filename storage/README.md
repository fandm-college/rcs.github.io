# Data Storage and Transfer

We recommend storing 
- Class data stored in Google in a shared drive (formerly known as a team drives)
- Research data stored 

## Globus

Globus is a cloud-based data management andtransfer platform that easily allows data transfer and sharing regardless of where that data is actually stored.

- Set it and forget it data transfers: Once you start the file transfer Globus works in the Cloud to complete the transfer.  
  You won't need to stay loggged in or even keep your computer on.
- Transfer large files quickly: Globus performs some optimazations to transfer the data as quickly as possible.  Even very large data transfers (e.g., hundreds of GB or more)
  can often be transferred in minutes.
