# SSH

SSH stands for **S**ecure **Shell** and is used to connect to a server to run programs.  When you connect, you will be using usuallybe a command-line based interface to interact with the server.
If you aren't familiar with such means of interaction and/or aren't familiar with the Linux operating system, we recommend looking through our Linux tutorial
beginning with the [introduction to the command line](../linux/01_commandline.md)  

Two quick notes related to `ssh`

1. The first time you connect to a seerver, you may see a message about the authenticity of the host.  Type `yes` (the entire word) to continue connecting.
2. If you are prompted for a password, when you type your password **nothing will display on the screen**.  There is no problem and the system does know which characters are being typed.

## Mac OS X

1. Open the terminal application
2. If you need to run a graphical application on the server (e.g., Matlab), start XQuartz (Go to Applications > Utilities > XQuartz).  This will open a window which just has to be running
3. Use the `ssh` command to connect to the server
    - `ssh <userName>@<serverName>` For example `ssh rliu7@rcs-scsn.fandm.edu`
    - In the case where you are running a graphical application, the command changes to `ssh -Y <userName>@<serverName>` as in `ssh -Y rliu7@rcs-scsn.fandm.edu`

## Windows

To setup a new connection

1. Put `<userName>@<serverName>` in the box labelled **Host Name (or IP address)** (label 1 in the picture below).  For example: `rliu7@rcs-scsn.fandm.edu`
2. Save the connection for easier access later by entering a name (whatever you want to call it) it in the box labelled **Saved Sessions** (label 2) and click **Save**

For sessions that run graphical applications, some adjustments must be made to the configuration:
  
1. Select the session that needs to use graphical applications and click **Load** 
2. In the box on the left-hand-side of the window labelled **Category:** click the following (in order)
    - **Connection**
    - **SSH**
    - **X11**
3. Check the box labelled **Enable X11 forwarding**.  At this point, your PuTTY window should look similar to the picture below.
4. Go back to the **Category:** box and click **Session**.  Then click **Save** to save the new settings.

To actually connect to a server, double click the name of the server in the **Saved Sessions** box, or single click it and then click **Open**.  If will be using a 
graphical application, you should start the VcXsrv application before connecting.

There may be times you wish to copy/paste text to/from the PuTTY window.  This can be done but doesn't work the way it normally would in Windows.
Instructions can be found [here](https://www.alphr.com/copy-paste-putty/) on how to do this.
