# Troubleshooting connection problems

From time to time you may encounter issues connecting especially using SSH/SCP.  Often times the cause is one of the following:

1. Not connecting to VPN when off-campus
2. Username is mistyped
3. Server name is mistyped
4. Password mistyped.  This can be trickier to determine but we recommend checking things like Cap Lock, Num Lock, etc.

If you continue to have issues connecting then contact us.
