# Setup SSH/SCP on personal computer

```note
You only need to use these instructions if you need SSH/SCP to access on of the compute resources
```

## Mac OS X setup

By default, Mac OS X comes with a program called `terminal` which can be used for connecting to our systems.  The terminal program can be found in  Utilities folder which can be quickly opened using the keyboard shortcut `Shift+Command+U`.  Once you click on the terminal program to open it, we suggest you save it to your toolbar for faster access in the future.

If you will need to use an application that displays graphical windows (e.g., Matlab) then you must install [XQuartz](https://www.xquartz.org/).

## Windows setup

For Windows we recommend installing PuTTY which can be found in the Microsoft Store (It's provided and updated by Simon Tatham).
If you will need to use an application that displays graphical windows (e.g., Matlab) we recommend you install [VcXsrv](https://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv/) (Click the green Download button). 

For scp we recommend using WinSCP which can be downloaded [here](https://winscp.net/eng/download.php)
