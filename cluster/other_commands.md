# Additional Slurm commands

## Slurm job queue

The `squeue` command is a tool that can be used to display information about the
jobs in queue. By default, the squeue command will print out the
*__job ID__*, *__partition__*, *__username__*, *__job status__*,
*__number of nodes__*, and *__name of nodes__* for all queued and running jobs.
For example:

```bash
JOBID PARTITION     NAME     USER ST       TIME  NODES NODELIST(REASON)
60149     nodes nil-neur nsengupt  R 1-19:38:33     15 n[07-21]
60187       osg bl_3jsGg    osg01 PD       0:00      1 (Priority)
60186       osg bl_lUjLu    osg01 PD       0:00      1 (Priority)
60184       osg bl_rqGUg    osg01 PD       0:00      1 (Priority)
60185       osg bl_Sixws    osg01 PD       0:00      1 (Priority)
60179       osg bl_8Afn2    osg01 PD       0:00      1 (Priority)
60178       osg bl_WWNqJ    osg01 PD       0:00      1 (Priority)
60177       osg bl_DqhRR    osg01 PD       0:00      1 (Priority)
60176       osg bl_5dXSj    osg01 PD       0:00      1 (Resources)
60175       osg bl_fthxT    osg01  R    6:23:21      1 n36
60174       osg bl_0OkIh    osg01  R    6:25:19      1 n32
60173       osg bl_9pmce    osg01  R    8:31:26      1 n35
60172       osg bl_effaH    osg01  R   12:24:54      1 n29
60167       osg bl_cdVsx    osg01  R   12:25:00      1 n30
60166       osg bl_87MDq    osg01  R   13:10:32      1 n33
60165       osg bl_4DTvm    osg01  R   13:32:17      1 n34
60164       osg bl_Lvpox    osg01  R   13:49:47      1 n31
```

In this case there are 17 jobs in the queue.  The column labeled `ST` gives the state of the job, with `R` indicating
that the job is running, and `PD` indicating that the job is pending.  There are many different job states including
`ST`, stopped, `OOM`, out of memory, and `F`, failed, but most of the time you see running and pending.

If you wish to see the state of only your jobs, you can use the `--user` flag as:

```bash
$ squeue --user=osg01
```

You can also  output additional information with the `--long` flag. This
flag will print out the non-abbreviated default information with the
addition of a *__timelimit__* field:

```bash
$ squeue --user=username --long
```

The squeue command also provides users with a means to display a
job's estimated start time by adding the `--start` flag to your
command. This will append Slurm's estimated start time for each job in
the output information.  However, the start time provided by this command
can be inaccurate. This is because the time calculated is based on
jobs queued or running in the system. If a job with a higher priority
is queued after the command is run, your job may be delayed.

```bash
$ squeue --user=username --start
```

For more information on squeue, [visit the Slurm page for squeue](https://slurm.schedmd.com/squeue.html)

## Stopping jobs

Sometimes you may need to stop a job entirely either while it’s running or before it starts. 
This can be done with the `scancel` command. 
The command looks like this:

```bash
$ scancel job-id
```

To cancel multiple jobs, you can use a comma-separated list of job IDs:

```bash
$ scancel job-id1, job-id2, jobid3
```

For more information, [visit the Slurm page for scancel](https://slurm.schedmd.com/scancel.html)

## Information on running jobs

The `sstat` command allows users to pull up status information
about  currently running jobs. This includes information about *__CPU usage__*,
*__task information__*, *__node information__*, *__resident set size(RSS)__* (i.e. memory usage), 
and *__virtual memory (VM)__*. The basic form for the `sstat` command is:
command as such:

```bash
$ sstat --jobs=job-id
```

By default, it will display a large amount of information.  Quite possibly more information than
you might want.  To limit the information displayed,
you can use the `--format` flag to choose only that information you want to see.
This flag takes a list of comma separated variables which specify the information to report:

```bash
$ sstat --jobs=job-id --format=var_1,var_2, ... , var_N
```

A chart of some these variables and their description is provided here:

Variable    | Description
------------|------------
avecpu      | Average CPU time of all tasks in job.
jobid       | The id of the Job.
ntasks      | Number of tasks in a job.

For an example, to print out a job's job id, average cpu time and number of tasks you would do:

```bash
sstat --jobs=job-id --format=jobid,avecpu,ntasks
```

A full list of variables that specify data handled by `sstat` can be
found with the `--helpformat` flag or by [visiting the slurm page for
sstat](https://slurm.schedmd.com/sstat.html).

## Information on completed jobs

### seff

The `seff` command provides somne useful and succint information on completed jobs, especially as it relates to the efficiency of resource usage (e.g., CPU and memory utilization).  
This command requires a job ID.  Below is an example running the command and associated output:

```bash
[auser@rcs-scsn neuron_mpi]$ seff 57957
Job ID: 57957
Cluster: rcs-sc
User/Group: auser/auser
State: COMPLETED (exit code 0)
Nodes: 4
Cores per node: 24
CPU Utilized: 2-13:11:03
CPU Efficiency: 99.24% of 2-13:39:12 core-walltime
Job Wall-clock time: 00:38:32
Memory Utilized: 2.32 GB
Memory Efficiency: 0.91% of 256.00 GB
```

Based on this output, we can see that it used 96 CPUs (Nodes * Cores per node) and that the CPU utilization  was very good, 99.24%  This basically means that pretty much all the CPUs were in use for the entire time the job ran.  Memory utilization was no so good though.  The job requested 256GB of memory but only used 2.32GB (.91% utilization).

### sacct

The `sacct` command allows users to see a wide range of information about completed jobs up.
This command is very similar to sstat.  Below are two examples.  The first gets information for
a specific job and the second gets job information for a specific user.

```bash
$ sacct --jobs=job-id
$ sacct --user=username
```

By default, sacct will retrieve jobs that were run during the current
day. You can use the `--starttime` flag to tell the command to examine jobs 
run further in the past as in this example:

```bash
$ sacct –-jobs=your_job-id –-starttime=YYYY-MM-DD
```

To see a non-abbreviated version of output, use the `--long`
flag:

```bash
$ sacct –--user=username –-starttime=YYYY-MM-DD --long
```

As with `sstat`, the information that is displayed can be adjusted using the `--format`.
This flags works exactly as described with `sstat`

As an example, suppose you want to find information about jobs that
were run on March 12, 2018. You want to show information regarding the
job name, the number of nodes used in the job, the number of cpus, and the elapsed time. Your command would look like this:

```bash
$ sacct --user=username --starttime=2018-03-12 --format=jobname,nnodes,ncpus,elapsed
```

As another example, suppose you would like to pull up information on
jobs that were run on February 21, 2018. You would like information on
job ID, job name, Number of Nodes used, Number of CPUs used, CPU time, Average CPU time, and elapsed time. Your
command would look like this:

```bash
$ sacct --user=username –-starttime=2018-02-21 --format=jobid,jobname,nnodes,ncpu,cputime,avecpu,elapsed
```

More details regarding `sacct` including a full list of fields that can be displayed 
with the `--format` flag can be found found with the `--helpformat` flag or by [visiting the slurm page for
sacct](https://slurm.schedmd.com/sacct.html).
