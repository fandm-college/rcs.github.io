# Research Computing resources for classes

Instructors who wish use any of the Research Computing resources for a class
should contact us at:

dorc@fandm.edu 

before the class begins to ensure that adequate resources and support are available.  
At a minimum, we would like the following information:  

- Software you wish to use
- A list of the netIDs of those who need access
- How long you a typical software run might take (best guess)

We also offer the following specialized resources which can be used for classes:

1. **math.fandm.edu** -- WeBWork server
2. **math-r.fandm.edu** -- RStudio server 
3. **jupyterhub.fandm.edu** -- Jupyter notebook server
