## Acknowledging Research Computing in research

We are asking that use of Franklin and Marshall Research Computing resources be 
acknowledged in research (papers, grant proposals, posters, etc.) as follows:

 - For research using the cluster:
   - "This work utilized the research cluster at Franklin and Marshall College which was funded through NSF grant 1925192."

- For research using resources other than the cluster:
  - "The authors acknowledge Research Computing Services at Franklin and Marshall College for providing computational resources and support that have contributed to the research results reported here."
