# Overview

Research Computing Services (RCS) supports the computational needs related to both research and teaching 
when those needs move beyond the capabailities of a standard personal computer.
Our goal is to make the access and use of specialized compute resources easier for faculty and students 
at Franklin & Marshall College as well as to facilitate collaboration across institutions.

## Research support

We provide assistance in the following areas:

| **Computing** | {::nomarkdown}<ul><li>High Performance Compute (HPC) cluster</li><li>GPU compute systems</li><li>High-memory compute systems</li></ul>{:/} |
