# Introduction to tmux

**UNDER CONSTRUCTION**

For programs that may run a long time (hours or more) that are not being run on the research cluster, we suggest using `tmux`.  Among 
the different things that it does, `tmux` easily allows you to keep programs running without the need to stay constantly connected to the 
compute resource.  Normally, when you exit/logoff from a Linux server, any programs you have running stop running.  Using `tmux` prevents this
from happening.  Here we will discuss the very basics of using `tmux` but there are additional more in depth tutorials which can be found 
on-line.
