# Linux basics

Most research computing resources use Linux as the operating system.  Although Linux does have a GUI similar to Windows and Mac OS X, more often than not you will be working at a command line interface which is text-based.  Here we provide some basic tutorials to help you gain some familiarity and comfort with the Linux command line interface.  More in-depth information can be found on the internet where there are many additional tutorials/explanations for topics and commands beyond those given here.  Please note that you will not have access to all commands you might find beyond those given here because some of them require administrator privileges.
