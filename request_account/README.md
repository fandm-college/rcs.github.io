# Request account

Before you can access many of the compute resources you will first need to request an account be setup.  With the exception of Globus and 
MATLAB (see instructions further below) account requests should be made by emailing dorc@fandm.edu.  When requesting an account, 
please provide the following information:

- Your netID (e.g. auser1)
- If your are a student, provide the name of the professor you are working with
- If for research, please provide
    - A brief description of the research
    - Any software packages you would like to use
- If for a class, please provide
    - The class designation (e.g., CPS322)
    - A list of netIDs for all people (faculty, students, TAs, etc.) who will need access
    - Software packages/modules you will need to use

In addition, if you will need to access resources from off-campus (i.e., you will not be on eduroam), you will have to connect to F&M's VPN, GlobalProtect, which uses
DUO for 2-factor authentication.  Instructions for installing these programs are provided below:
